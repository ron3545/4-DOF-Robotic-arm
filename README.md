# ROBOTICS
This is a project conducted and presented on June 6, 2023.
This 4DOF articulated Robotic arm uses dc motors as its main actuators. For sensor, it uses AS5600 magnetic encoder for reading the position of eanch joints.
Each motor is connetrelled by PID to ensure that the motor positions it self in a right manner, with its speed also controlled. The system uses Arduino mega, 2 l298n motor drivers
and A4988 stepper driver.
